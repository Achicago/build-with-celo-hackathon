# CarbonX Decentralized Application: CarbonX  

  # Abstract 
Decentralized applications developed using blockchain technology provide innovative business models to serve the human race 
and solve existing challenges. Climate change is one of the biggest problems humanity is facing and there is a dearth of solutions in 
tackling  this  grave  impediment to the long-term sustainability  of our  planet. Accountability,  greenwashing, traceability, impact 
assessment and trading of carbon credits are unresolved issues in the  ESG sector. In this paper, we present a novel decentralized 
application  software, CarbonX,  that  solves the  enumerated  problems using  NFTs  on the  blockchain  platform, through  smart 
contracts.  The  paper describes the  functional  architecture  of CarbonX,  while  elaborating  on its  salient  features  and utility  in 
sustainable  finance,  in  particular  green  sukuk.  CarbonX  is  a  pioneering  software  providing  an  exchange  for  trading  of  carbon 
credits.  The software facilitates logging  of  impact and  traceable  transactions  in  a carbon  market,  that  would help  to  prevent 
duplication of records and greenwashing. The paper discusses the efforts being undertaken to achieve the climate goals as per the 
Paris Agreement and  also highlights the pivotal  obstacles to  achieving carbon  neutrality by  2050, as per  COP26. The  paper also 
encompasses a study on the applications of dapps in DeFi, Web 3.0 and ESG, among other areas and gives  a comparative analysis 
of  blockchain  platforms  for  dapp  development.  The  paper  is  also  a  pioneer  in  highlighting  the  challenges  that  plague  dapp 
development, deployment and usage.
